# Unit 7 - Creative Animation with The Theater Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will create an animation using The Theater that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose. Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism** – Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.
- **Method decomposition** – Use overloaded, overridden, and private methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.
- **Use at least two data structures** - Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or ArrayLists to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Write a description the personal interest or problem that your animation addresses. Then explain the user story(s) you identified, and how they help frame making your animation.
This project is based on one of my favorite shows Family Guy. Zuhair and I wanted to do a fight scene and we chose to depict the fight scene between Peter Griffina and the Giant Chicken. These scenes are reoccuring gags and are always interesting to watch since the cartoonish destruction that comes with the fights. Our project shows Peter Griffin and the Chicken fighting going between three different scenes. As they fight explosions go off in the background and at the final scene peter kicks the chciken off the screen and  walks away into the sunset. Our user story is resembeling the fight between Peter Griffin and the giant chicken that reoccurs in family guy, and creating an animation to go along with it. It helped create an idea for what kind of scenes happen like how Peter and the Chicken fight across mutiple background like how in the show they often end up very far from where the fight started. Aswell as framing how in the end of every fight Peter always walks off into the distance, usually the sunset.
